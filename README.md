# Fully-Automated-Azure-Infrastructure-Powered-by-Terraform-DevSecOps
Automate your Azure cloud with Terraform! Built with DevSecOps in mind for secure, scalable, and repeatable infrastructure deployments.


🚀 From Zero to Fully Automated Azure Infrastructure – Powered by Terraform & DevSecOps 🚀

💥 100% Production-Ready | Fully Automated | Enterprise-Grade Azure Infrastructure 💥

Proudly presenting my latest project:
Azure Cloud Infrastructure from scratch to full automation, fully modular, secure, and scalable, built with Terraform + DevSecOps best practices.

🌟 Overview

This repository provides a complete Azure infrastructure stack following DevSecOps principles, supporting multi-environment setups (Dev & Prod) with zero-touch automation.

Architecture Flow:
Resource Group → VNet → Subnets → NSG → ASG → NIC → VMs → Bastion → Application Gateway → SQL + Private Endpoints → Storage → Key Vault → Log Analytics → Application Insights → AKS → ACR → Role Assignments

All resources are modular, reusable, secure, and monitored, enabling fast, consistent, and reliable deployments.

✅ Key Features

Terraform Modules: Multi-environment modules with foreach, locals, dynamic blocks, and lifecycle management — reusable and scalable.

CI/CD Pipelines: Azure DevOps YAML pipelines with linting, security scans (Trivy, Tfsec, Checkov), approvals, and zero-downtime deployments.

Security & Governance: RBAC, Key Vault integration, Policy enforcement, private endpoints, secure networking.

Monitoring & Diagnostics: Azure Monitor, Log Analytics, Application Insights, dynamic diagnostic settings across all resources.

Private Connectivity: Fully private endpoints for Storage & SQL.

Enterprise-Ready: Scalable, compliant, production-grade architecture.
